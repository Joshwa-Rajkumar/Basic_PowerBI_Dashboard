# 📊 Power BI Sales Dashboard – Project by Joshwa Rajkumar

## 🧠 About the Project

As part of my learning journey in data analytics, I created this interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales data across various dimensions such as time, region, customer segment, and product category.

My goal was to uncover valuable insights from raw data and present them in a clean, visual format that supports business decision-making.

## 🗃️ Dataset Details

I used a single table containing the following important fields:

- **Order Date**
- **Customer Name**
- **Sales**
- **Profit**
- **Order ID**
- **Segment**
- **Region**
- **Category** and **Sub-Category**

## 📌 What I Built

### KPI Cards  
- **No. of Sales** – Total quantity of items sold  
- **Sum of Profit** – Total profit earned  
- **Total Orders** – Number of distinct customer orders  

### Top 10 Customers by Sales  
- A ranked table showing the top 10 customers based on total sales along with the number of orders they placed.

### Sales Trend Chart  
- A combo chart displaying **sum of sales** and **sum of profit** by month for the selected year.

### Regional Sales Distribution  
- A donut chart showing how sales are distributed across **East, West, Central, and South** regions.

### Segment-wise Performance  
- A pie chart comparing sales and profit across **Consumer**, **Corporate**, and **Home Office** segments.

### Filters and Slicers  
- Added slicers for **Year, Region, Segment, Category, and Sub-Category** so users can interact with the report dynamically.
